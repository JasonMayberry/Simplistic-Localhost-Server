# Simplistic-Localhost-Server
The most simplistic localhost server that I can find.

## How to use .....
**Install node.js if you don't already have it.**
1. Just save a copy of "serve-local.js" in the folder with the content you wish to serve.
2. Edit the variable local_file_to_be_served = 'index.html' to the filename you wish to serve.
3. CD to the folder in the terminal.
4. Type: node serve-local.js
5. Then open your browser to http://localhost:3000/
